# iOS build (preparation)

Static GLib and `qemu-system-arm` for the iOS simulator or devices. Run on macOS with Xcode and
`meson` on `PATH`. Source archives are the same pinned inputs as the Android build.

```sh
ios/build_glib_ios.sh iphoneos arm64 /path/to/archives /new/glib-work
ios/build_qemu_ios.sh iphoneos arm64 tcg /path/to/qemu-10.2.1.tar.xz /path/to/dtc.tar \
  /new/glib-work/prefix/usr/local /new/qemu-work
```

`tcg` needs JIT on the device (for example enabled through StikJIT) and runs with
`-accel tcg,split-wx=on`; `tci` is the slower interpreter that works without JIT.
iOS cannot spawn processes, so the app will have to run QEMU in-process; that is not done yet.
